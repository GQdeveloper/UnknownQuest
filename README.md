# UnknownQuest
A text-based dungeon game RPG

It is about a person waking up in a strange place with portals and other paths that he/she can use.
depending on your choices you can either move to the next or previous level, or find enemies,
chess with items, or nothing at all.

The main part of this game logic is its level system. I used a doubly-linked list to populate the nodes with level objects,
each level object contains up to four rooms all of these are connected. This is because each level contains four rooms,
so, we want to be able to move between rooms within the level.
