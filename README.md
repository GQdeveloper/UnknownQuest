# UnknownQuest
A text-based dungeon game RPG
---
It is about a person waking up in a strange place with portals and other paths that he/she can use.
depending on your choices you can either move to the next or previous level, find enemies,
chess with items, or nothing at all; all these events are random.

---

I would like to mention that, I used a doubly-linked list data structure to populate the nodes with level objects,
each level object contains four rooms all of these are interconnected. This is because  we want to be able to move between 
rooms within the level. And since the leves are within a node this allows us to move between levels.
