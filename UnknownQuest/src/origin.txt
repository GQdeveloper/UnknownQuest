Deep in your thoughts, you can hear the wind blowing and owls making noises,
deeply also a constant sound like sand moving.
You feel cold, suddenly you open your eyes and realized that you are outside.
Completely confused, you look around and notice two big strange light sources.

One Red and the other Black, you can feel how the air is being absorbed by these things,
it is like founding a portal, you think.

You look around and notice that you are in the middle of a forest,
But you remembered being at home last night. 

WTF, HOW AM I OUT HERE!?
And, what are those things?
