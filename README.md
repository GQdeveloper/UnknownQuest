# UnknownQuest
A text-based dungeon game RPG
---
It is about a person waking up in a strange place with portals and other paths that he/she can use.
depending on your choices you can either move to the next or previous level, find enemies,
chess with items, or nothing at all; all these events are random.

## How It Works

Thanks to OOP, I used a doubly-linked list data structure to populate the nodes with level objects,
each level object contains four rooms all of these are interconnected. This is because  we want to be able to move between 
rooms within the level. And since the leves are within a node this allows us to move between levels.

Created the necessary classes for the idea I had in mind. I used these classes accordingly, along with conditionals and loops, to
obtain the desired control flow of the game. I just wanted to create a simple game by using a data structure.
